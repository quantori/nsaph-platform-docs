## Building documentation
        
Building documentation requires Python 3.8 or later.
First, install all requirements by executing command:

    pip install -r < requirements.txt 

To build the documentation, all project repositories should be
cloned to the same root directory. This root directory is given to the
build script as an argument. Run:

    ./build.sh

section in the main doc.
