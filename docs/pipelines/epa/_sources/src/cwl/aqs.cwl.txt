  This workflow downloads AQS data from the government
  servers, introspects it to infer the database schema
  and ingests the data into the database
  Example run:
  cwl-runner aqs.cwl sample_aqs.yml

inputs:
  proxy:
    type: string?
    default: ""
    doc: HTTP/HTTPS Proxy if required
  database:
    type: File
    doc: Path to database connection file, usually database.ini
  connection_name:
    type: string
    doc: The name of the section in the database.ini file
  aggregation:
    type: string
  parameter_code:
    type: string
    doc: |
      Parameter code. Either a numeric code (e.g. 88101, 44201)
      or symbolic name (e.g. PM25, NO2).

steps:
  states:
    run: ensure_resource.cwl

      Ensures the presence of `us_states` table in the database.
      The table contains mapping between state names, ids
      (two letter abbreviations), FIPS codes and
      [ISO-3166-2 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2)

    doc: |
      Ensures the presence of `us_iso` table in the database.
      The table provides a mapping between states, counties and zip
      codes. It contains FIPS and
